      The origin of the croissant can actually be traced back to 13th century
      Austria, where it was called the kipferl, the German word for crescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      However it was an Austrian artillery officer August Zang who founded a
      Viennese bakery at 92, rue du richelieu in Paris. It served Viennese
      specialties including kipferl and the Vienna loaf. This bakery inspired
      imitators and the French version of the kipferl was named after the shape
      given to it: a crescent, the French word being croissant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jim Chevallier, an independent scholar and author of the book “August Zang
      and the French Croissant: How Viennoiserie Came to France” says that while
      the croissant may have had Austrian origins, the French made it their own:
      “The croissant began as the Austrian kipferl but became French the moment
      people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French innovation.”
      And: “It has fully taken root in its adopted land.” If you were to order a
      kipferl in Austria today, you will most likely be given a cookie rather
      than a pastry, with the only resemblance to the croissant being its
      crescent shape.
